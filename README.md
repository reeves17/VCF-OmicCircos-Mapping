# VCF-OmicCircos-Mapping

* All of the text files I used to generate the OmicCircos plot are in this repository
* The python code to convert from a VCF file to data OmicCircos can use is included. IT IS COMBINED INTO SETS OF 100K
* Segment-arc.txt is derived from a P. trichocarpa .fai file
* I would have included the gff conversion code, but I need to clean it up a lot. It got pretty convoluted
